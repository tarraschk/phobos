NData boosts productivity and quality of NGUI based User Interface development in Unity3D with

Automatic data binding, following the popular MVVM pattern.
With EZData you can build large scale, high quality user interfaces that are still stable, maintainable and robust.

Features

Two-way text bindings (including multi-bindings) with native .NET formatting capabilities.
Flexible bindings that allow visible and checked states of UI controls to be bound to properties in your code (also in two-way mode for check-boxes bound to boolean values).
Command bindings for buttons and text fields interaction that will trigger actions in your code.
Items source binding for connecting list control with attached item template prefab to collection of items in your code.
Code snippets for notifiable properties and collections for Visual Studio and Mono Develop.
Editor script for bindings validation.



Overview

MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern is one of the popular ways of separating UI from application logic. When powered by reflection based data bindings it allows writing an extremely clean code in both View, which is in case EZGUI controls hierarchy, and ViewModel which is basically an hierarchy of simple objects containing simple properties (like Boolean, int, string and Texture2D values) and collections of other simple objects. Simplicity of this objects means that they ideally don't have any logic and serve only like an hierarchical representation of user interface state. To enable interaction of user interface with application/game logic, objects in ViewModel can contain methods called commands, which are as simple as can be imagined -  void returning public methods without parameters. They don't have to be bound explicitly to UI controls like it used to be with regular events handlers. But rather this commands are invoked through command bindings. When command is invoked in order to perform some actions in Model (loading next game level, submitting score to the server, etc.), ViewModel invokes Model methods. If Model requires some data from UI as an arguments (like player name for score submission), this data is just taken from ViewModel, because it's already there thanks to the automatic data synchronization with two-way data bindings. When the action is finished, Model makes changes in ViewModel by changing appropriate properties. This changes made in a single property get automatically notified to all UI elements that rely on this property value.

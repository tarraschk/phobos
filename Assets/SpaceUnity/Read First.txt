*** WHAT'S NEW? ***

VERSION 1.02
  
 FIXES

 * Changed name to SPACE for Unity due to Unity Asset Store policy conflict.

 * Prefixed all scripts with “SU_” to avoid naming conflicts.

 * Prefab: SpaceUnity/Prefabs/SpaceSceneElements/LocalStar<Large/Medium/Small>
     Flickering Planets in Unity 4
       Changed Range of child Point light from 1E+10 to 100000 because it made
       the planet textures flicker in Unity v4. (Unity 3.5 supported “Infinity”
       for point lights which didn’t work in 4.0 and apparently too high of a
       range causes flickering, presumably due to some floating point issues.)
       Note: If you have created Local Stars in your scene with broken prefab
       connection you will need to set these values manually as well on scenes
       you created.

     Missing white star disc after disappearing out of view in Unity 4
       The white star disc disappeared in Unity v4 after the local star had
       once been out of view. This was not the case in v3.5. On child
       ParticleSystem-Disc, changed Duration and Lifetime from Infinity to 100
       and set particle system to looping to looping which keeps the disc
       visible at all times.

 * Script: SU_SpaceSceneSwitcher.cs
    Added compiler version verification to use SetActive instead of deprecated
    command SetActiveRecursively in Unity v4

 * Scene: "Demo - Planet Climates"
    Enabled gameObjects MeshEngines and MeshSpaceship that were accidentally
    disabled before.
   
 * Planet Material: "Planet-Desert-OrangeWithImpacts"
    Added missing label "atmosphere-brown-medium" because planets of this type
    didn't receive an atmosphere when created due to the missing label on the 
    asset.

 * Scene: "Demo - Colorized Red" 
    Set background stars (which was missing) texture for SpaceScene camera.

 * Prefabs: _Demo/Prefabs/SpaceScene1 & SpaceScene2
    Added background stars (which was missing) in SpaceScene1.
    Replaced local stars which were not rendering prominence and cascades.

VERSION 1.01 

 First public release.
